## High Priority

1. Protocol to support n mm forward and degrees left or right.
2. Publish wheel position, movements.

## Low Priority

1. Support bipropellent-protocol
2. Why does the AT32 board power on when UART is connected to USB? GD32 board with bipropellent-hoverboard-firmware didn't have that problem.
